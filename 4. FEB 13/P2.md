## 🔍 Aim
To determine whether a given point lies inside or outside a triangle using coordinate geometry.

## 🧠 Algorithm
We use the area method: If the sum of areas of sub-triangles formed with the point equals the main triangle's area, the point lies inside.

## 📈 Time Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(1) per check
