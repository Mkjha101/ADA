# 🧪 Matrix Multiplication - Algorithm Lab Work

## 🔍 Aim
To implement matrix multiplication using the divide-and-conquer strategy and analyze its time complexity.

## 🧠 Algorithm
We divide the matrix into quadrants and recursively perform 8 multiplications on the submatrices to compute the final result. This recursive method uses the basic divide-and-conquer principle without reducing multiplication count like Strassen’s algorithm.

## 📈 Time Complexity
- Recursive Method: O(n³)
- Standard Matrix Multiplication: O(n³)
- Memory: O(n²) for matrices

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- Computer Graphics (transformation matrices)
- Scientific Simulations
- Machine Learning (Neural Networks)
- Cryptography
