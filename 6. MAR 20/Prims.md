# Prim's Algorithm

## Aim:
To find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph using Prim's Algorithm.

## Time Complexity:
O(E log V), where E is edges and V is vertices (with a priority queue).

## Algorithm:
1. Start from an arbitrary node.
2. Add the smallest edge connecting MST to a new node.
3. Repeat until all nodes are included.

## Applications:
- Real-time network routing
- Minimum wiring/cabling layout
- Cluster analysis
