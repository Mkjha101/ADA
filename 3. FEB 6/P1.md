# 🧪 Fractional Knapsack

## 🔍 Aim
To implement the Fractional Knapsack algorithm using Greedy Strategy and analyze its time complexity.

## 🧠 Algorithm
The fractional knapsack problem is solved using a greedy approach where we sort items based on value-to-weight ratio and take the highest ratio items until the capacity is full.

## 📈 Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** O(n log n)
- **Greedy Selection:** O(n)
- **Overall:** O(n log n)

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- Resource allocation problems
- Load distribution in cloud computing
- Budget optimization in project planning
- Bandwidth assignment in networking
