## 🔍 Aim
To select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities from a list of start and end times using a greedy approach.

## 🧠 Algorithm
- Sort activities by their end times.
- Select the first activity, then keep selecting next ones that start after the last selected one ends.

## 📈 Time Complexity
- Sorting: O(n log n)
- Selection: O(n)
- Total: O(n log n)

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- CPU job scheduling
- Room reservation systems
- Event planning and management systems
