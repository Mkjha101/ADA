## 🔍 Aim
To compute the convex hull from a set of 2D points using Graham’s Scan algorithm.

## 🧠 Algorithm
- Select the point with lowest y-coordinate as reference.
- Sort other points by polar angle with reference.
- Traverse sorted list and remove points that cause a right turn using a stack.

## 📈 Time Complexity
- Sorting: O(n log n)
- Traversal: O(n)
- Total: O(n log n)

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- Pattern recognition and image processing
- Collision detection in computer graphics
- Pathfinding and geographical mapping
