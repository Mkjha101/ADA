# Matrix Multiplication using Divide and Conquer (Strassen’s Algorithm)

## 🔍 Aim
To implement matrix multiplication using the divide and conquer technique (Strassen’s Algorithm) and analyze its time complexity graphically.

## 🧠 Algorithm
Strassen’s algorithm improves on the classical O(n³) matrix multiplication by reducing the number of recursive multiplications from 8 to 7, achieving a time complexity of approximately **O(n^2.81)**.
1. Divide each matrix into four submatrices.
2. Compute 7 new matrices (P1 to P7) using a combination of additions and subtractions.
3. Combine them into the final result matrix using a specific formula.

## ⏱ Time Complexity
- **Worst Case:** O(n^2.81)
- **Best Case:** Still O(n^2.81) since divide-and-conquer always divides the matrix regardless of content.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n^2) for storing submatrices and intermediate results.

## 📊 Graph Description
The graph compares:
- Actual execution time for multiplying two n x n matrices.
- Expected time growth using the theoretical function ~n^2.81.

Both are plotted against increasing matrix sizes (powers of 2) to show how closely Strassen's algorithm follows its expected complexity.
