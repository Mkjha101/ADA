## 🔍 Aim
To find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

## 🧠 Algorithm
- Initialize all distances to infinity, except the source node which is set to 0.
- Use a min-heap (priority queue) to repeatedly choose the nearest unvisited node.
- For each neighbor of the current node, update the distance if a shorter path is found.

## 📈 Time Complexity
- Using min-heap: O((V + E) log V)
- Where V = number of vertices, E = number of edges

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- GPS navigation systems
- Network routing protocols
- Robot path planning
- Project planning and resource management
