## 🔍 Aim
To implement Bubble Sort algorithm and analyze its time complexity using a graph comparing actual execution time and expected quadratic time.

## 🧠 Algorithm
Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the array is sorted.

## 📈 Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n) — when the array is already sorted.
- **Average Case:** O(n²)
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- Teaching and learning sorting algorithms
- Useful in cases where input is nearly sorted
- Simple implementation for small datasets
