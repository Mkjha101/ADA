# 🧪 Insertion Sort - Algorithm Lab Work

## 🔍 Aim
To implement Insertion Sort algorithm and analyze its time complexity using a graph comparing actual execution time and expected quadratic time.

## 🧠 Algorithm
Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one item at a time by comparing each new element with those already sorted and inserting it into its correct position.

## 📈 Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n) — when array is already sorted
- **Average Case:** O(n²)
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- Good for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays
- Used in online sorting (where data keeps arriving)
- Used as a base in more advanced sorting algorithms like TimSort
