# 🧪 Quick Sort

## 🔍 Aim
To implement Quick Sort algorithm and analyze its time complexity using a graph comparing actual execution time and expected log-linear time.

## 🧠 Algorithm
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot such that elements less than pivot go to the left and greater go to the right. It is applied recursively to the subarrays.

## 📈 Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n log n)
- **Average Case:** O(n log n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n²) — when pivot is smallest/largest element every time

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- Widely used for in-place sorting
- Used in libraries like C++ STL `sort()`, Python’s `sorted()`
- Efficient for large datasets
