# 🧪 Merge Sort

## 🔍 Aim
To implement Merge Sort algorithm and analyze its time complexity using a graph comparing actual execution time and expected log-linear time.

## 🧠 Algorithm
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

## 📈 Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n log n)
- **Average Case:** O(n log n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n log n)

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- Used in external sorting where large datasets are involved
- Efficient for linked lists and large arrays
- Basis of advanced algorithms like Timsort
