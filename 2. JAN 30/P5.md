# 🧪 Heap Sort

## 🔍 Aim
To implement Heap Sort algorithm and analyze its time complexity using a graph comparing actual execution time and expected log-linear time.

## 🧠 Algorithm
Heap Sort first builds a max heap from the input array. The largest element (root) is then repeatedly swapped with the last element and the heap is reduced and heapified again.

## 📈 Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n log n)
- **Average Case:** O(n log n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n log n)

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- Priority queues and scheduling systems
- External sorting where recursion is expensive
- Sorting large datasets with fixed memory
