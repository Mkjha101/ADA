# 🔍 Aim
To implement Selection Sort algorithm and analyze its time complexity.

# 🧠 Algorithm
1. Start from the first element and assume it is the minimum.
2. Traverse the rest of the array to find the actual minimum.
3. Swap the found minimum with the first element.
4. Repeat the process for the next element.
5. Continue until the entire array is sorted.

# 📈 Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n²)
- **Average Case:** O(n²)
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)

Reason: It always performs nested loops irrespective of initial order.

# 🚀 Applications / Uses
- Useful when memory write operations are costly, as it makes minimum number of swaps.
- Helpful in small datasets where simplicity is preferred over performance.
- Used in teaching basic sorting principles in computer science.
