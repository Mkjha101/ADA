<!-- Part 1: Aim -->
## 🔍 Aim
<p>
<ul>
<li> To find all <b> Peaks </b> in a given array.
<ul> <li> <b> Note: </b> A peak is defined as an element that is <u> greater than its neighbors </u>. </li> </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Iterate through each element of the array.
2. For each element:
   - If it is the **first element**, check if it is greater than the second element.
   - If it is the **last element**, check if it is greater than the second last element.
   - For **middle elements**, check if it is greater than both its immediate neighbors.
3. Store the result (1 for peak, 0 otherwise) in a separate array.
<!-- 
4. Measure the runtime for different input sizes and calculate the average over 100 iterations for each size.
5. Output the observation array and time array for plotting time complexity.
-->

## 📊 Observations & Time
The code prints:
- The **input sizes** (observations)
- The **average execution time** in seconds for each input size
- These outputs are formatted for easy graph plotting

## 📈 Time Complexity
**O(n)**  
Each element is checked exactly once to determine whether it's a peak, leading to linear time complexity.

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- Used in **signal processing** to detect spikes
- Helpful in **local maximum** detection in data arrays
<!-- - Common interview question for practicing array manipulation and algorithm analysis -->
