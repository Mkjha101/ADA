<!-- Part 1: Aim -->
## Aim
<p>
<ul>
<li> To find all <b> Peaks </b> in a given array.
<ul> <li> <b> Note: </b> A peak is defined as an element that is <u> greater than its neighbors </u>. </li> </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

## Algorithm

1. Iterate through each element of the array.
2. For each element:
   - If it is the **first element**, check if it is greater than the second element.
   - If it is the **last element**, check if it is greater than the second last element.
   - For **middle elements**, check if it is greater than both its immediate neighbors.
3. Store the result (1 for peak, 0 otherwise) in a separate array.
4. Measure the runtime for different input sizes and calculate the average over 100 iterations for each size.
5. Output the observation array and time array for plotting time complexity.

## ðŸ“Š Observations & Time
The code prints:
- The **input sizes** (observations)
- The **average execution time** in seconds for each input size
- These outputs are formatted for easy graph plotting
