## 🔍 Aim:
To compute `a^b` (a raised to the power b) using a **divide-and-conquer** strategy known as Exponentiation by Squaring.

## 🧠 Algorithm:
1. If b == 0, return 1.
2. Recursively compute half = a^(b//2).
3. If b is even: return half * half.
4. If b is odd: return a * half * half.
- This avoids repeated multiplications and dramatically reduces computation time.

## 📈 Time Complexity:
- O(log b) — Each step halves the exponent.

## 💡 Space Complexity:
- O(log b) due to recursive call stack.

## 🚀 Applications:
- Cryptography (RSA, Diffie-Hellman, etc.)
- Modular exponentiation
- Numerical computing
- Competitive programming
