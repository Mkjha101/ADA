## 🔍 Aim:
To generate a Magic Square of size **n x n** (only when n is odd) such that:

The sum of each row, column, and both diagonals is the same.

All numbers from **1** to **n^2** are used exactly once.

## 🧠 Algorithm 
**(Siamese Method):**
1. Place `1` at the middle of the top row.
2. The next number is placed diagonally up and right.
3. If the position is already occupied or goes out of bounds:
- Move down one row instead.
4. Repeat this process until n^2 is reached.

## 🧾 Magic Constant Formula
For an 'n x n' magic square, the magic constant (sum of each row/column/diagonal) is:
<center> 𝑀=𝑛(𝑛^2+1)/2 </center>
​
## ⚠️ Note:
This program only works for odd values of n.
Even-order magic squares (doubly even or singly even) require different algorithms.

## 📈 Time Complexity
- O(n²) — Every cell is filled once with constant-time work.

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- Puzzle design (like Sudoku, Lo Shu square)
- Mathematics and recreational logic
- Cryptographic grid generation
