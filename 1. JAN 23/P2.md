## 🔍 Aim
<ul>
<li> To find all the peaks in a 2-dimensional array, where a peak is an element that is greater than all of its valid adjacent neighbors (top, bottom, left, right).</li>
<ul> <li> <b> Note: </b>
<ol> <li> Here, we have not considered the case of neighbours having same value. </li>
<li> We have not considered the diagonal neighbours here.</li>
</ol> </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Take a 2D matrix of size `m × n` as input.
2. Traverse each element of the matrix.
3. For every element, compare it with its valid adjacent neighbors:
   - Top (i-1, j)
   - Bottom (i+1, j)
   - Left (i, j-1)
   - Right (i, j+1)
4. If the current element is greater than **all its valid neighbors**, mark that position as a peak (`1`), else mark it as `0`.
5. Display the matrix of peaks.

## 📊 Observations & Time
The code prints:
- The **input sizes** (observations)
- The **average execution time** in seconds for each input size
- These outputs are formatted for easy graph plotting
-->

## 📈 Time Complexity
**O(m × n)** — where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix.
Each element in the matrix is visited exactly once, and compared with at most 4 neighbors.

## 🚀 Applications / Uses
- 📷 **Image Processing**: Detecting bright spots or local maxima in images.
- 🌄 **Geographical Mapping**: Identifying elevation peaks in terrain maps.
- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Spotting local maxima in 2D datasets or heatmaps.
- 🎮 **Game Development**: Terrain generation or obstacle positioning in level design.
